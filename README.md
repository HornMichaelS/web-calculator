# Web Calculator Project

This project is primarily an exercise in accurately converting a design to an interactive web application. The technologies used were simply HTML, CSS, and javascript, with no frameworks.

## Calculator Functionality

The calculator is meant to emulate a classic 4-function calculator. To accomplish this, I decided to use a semi-functional paradigm, where the calculator was represented by a small set of properties. Operations were written so that they would create a new state, rather than modifying the current state.
